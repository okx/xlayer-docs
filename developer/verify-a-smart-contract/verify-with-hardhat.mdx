# Verifying with Hardhat
There are currently two methods to verify your code on [OKLink](https://www.oklink.com/ "OKLink"). You can either use the recommended [@okxweb3/hardhat-explorer-verify](https://github.com/okx/hardhat-explorer-verify "hardhat plugin") plugin, or modify the `hardhat.config.js` file according to Hardhat's [official documentation](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/verifying "documentation").

## Important notes
1. First, you need to apply for a key in [OKLink browser](https://www.oklink.com/docs/en/#quickstart-guide-getting-started "OKLink guide").
2. After you deploy your contract code, make sure to wait at least one minute before verifying it.

## Verify by using plugin (Recommended)

## Example
1. First, install the plugin in your Hardhat project by using the following command:

```npm install @okxweb3/hardhat-explorer-verify```

2. In your Hardhat configuration file (usually hardhat.config.js or hardhat.config.ts), import and configure the plugin. ensure that your network configuration and API keys are correctly set. Here is a sample configuration: 

``` import { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";
import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox";
import '@okxweb3/hardhat-explorer-verify';  // Import the plugin

const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  solidity: "0.8.20",
  sourcify: {
    enabled: true,
  },
  networks: {
    xlayer: {
      url: "https://xlayerrpc.example.com",
      accounts: ["<Your Wallet Private Key>"],
    },
  },
  etherscan: {
     apiKey: '...'
  },
  okxweb3explorer: {
    apiKey: "<Your API Key>",
  }
};

export default config;
```

3. After deploying the contracts, use Hardhat to run the verification script. This typically involves running a specific Hardhat task that automatically fetches the contract data and submitting it to the OKX Chain explorer for verification.
Here is an example command:

```npx hardhat okverify --network xlayer <Your Contract Address>```

4. Once verification is successful, you can view the verification status and the contract code on the OKX Chain blockchain explorer.

5. Verify TransparentUpgradeableProxy contract

An example command:

``` npx hardhat okxverify --network xlayer --contract <Contract>:<Name> --proxy <address>```

- `--proxy` refers to the proxy contract address.

<Tip title="Note"> If you are using **897 Contract**, you do not need to add `--proxy`. Instead, replace it with `--contract`.</Tip>


## Verify by modifying hardhat.config.js (Alternative)

## Example
1. Start by creating a Hardhat project and using the Lock contract as an example. 
2. Next, modify the `hardhat.config.js` file in your project directory with the following changes.
For X Layer testnet or mainnet:
```solidity
module.exports = {
    solidity: "0.8.9",
    networks: {
        xlayer: {
            url: "https://testrpc.xlayer.tech/terigon", //or https://rpc.xlayer.tech for mainnet
            accounts: [process.env.PRIVKEY]
        }
    },
    etherscan: {
        apiKey: process.env.ETHERSCAN_KEY,
        customChains: [
            {
                network: "xlayer",
                chainId: 195, //196 for mainnet
                urls: {
                    apiURL: "https://www.oklink.com/api/v5/explorer/contract/verify-source-code-plugin/XLAYER_TESTNET", //or https://www.oklink.com/api/v5/explorer/contract/verify-source-code-plugin/XLAYER for mainnet
                    browserURL: "https://www.oklink.com/xlayer-test" //or https://www.oklink.com/xlayer for mainnet
                }
            }
        ]
    }
};
```
Replace `process.env.PRIVKEY` with your own deployment address’s private key, and `process.env.ETHERSCAN_KEY` can be filled with your OKLink API Key, which can be applied from [My account - API management] on https://www.oklink.com/ for free

3. Compile your Hardhat contract code and deploy it with this command:
```javascript
hh run scripts/deploy.js --network xlayer
```

4. Wait for one to two minutes, and then verify the contract by running the following command and specifying the contract file you want to verify.
```javascript
hh verify --contract contracts/Lock.sol:Lock <address> <unlock time> --network xlayer
```

5. Check if the contract has been successfully verified by visiting  [here](https://www.oklink.com/xlayer-test/address/0xa6Ae4dc27a7a9fa2D26BC7CeFBd41Db406553fC8#code/ "Testnet OKLink") for testnet, or [here](https://www.oklink.com/xlayer/address/0x21F2018Fe98f49C15Fab002f3D4cFBE9D6EeA88b#code "Mainnet OKLink") for mainnet.
