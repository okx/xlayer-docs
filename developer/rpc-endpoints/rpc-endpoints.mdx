## Prerequisite readings
Before you begin using RPC endpoints on X Layer, it’s important to read the relevant articles for guidance:
- [Ethereum JSON-RPC](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API "Ethereum JSON-RPC")

## Starting HTTP JSON-RPC
To start the HTTP JSON-RPC, curl method is recommended:
```shell
# mainnet
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://rpc.xlayer.tech
# testnet
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://testrpc.xlayer.tech
```

## 1. APIs

### Realtime APIs

#### Overview
X Layer's Real-time API transforms blockchain user experience by delivering transaction confirmations in 20-30 milliseconds - that's 20-40x faster than traditional blockchain operations. By streaming pre-confirmed transactions and state data directly from the sequencer, developers can build truly responsive blockchain applications that rival traditional web experiences.

#### Key Benefits
- **Ultra-low latency**: Transaction confirmations in 20-30ms vs standard 400ms+ block times
- **Full EVM compatibility**: Complete support for all standard Ethereum JSON-RPC calls with "pending" tag
- **Real-time state access**: Query the latest blockchain state without waiting for block finalization
- **Seamless integration**: Minimal code changes required - simply replace "latest" with "pending"
- **Enhanced user experience**: Near-instant feedback for wallets, payments, and DeFi applications
- **Superior API coverage**: Unlike competitors, supports full eth_call functionality on pending blocks

#### How It Works

**Traditional vs Real-time Flow**

Traditional Blockchain Flow:
1. User submits transaction → Transaction pool
2. Wait for block to be minted (400ms+)
3. Block propagation to RPC nodes
4. User sees confirmation

X Layer Real-time Flow:
1. User submits transaction → Transaction pool
2. Sequencer immediately streams transaction data + state changes
3. RPC nodes apply changes to in-memory cache
4. Instant confirmation (20-30ms)

#### Technical Architecture
The Real-time feature operates through two primary data streams from the sequencer:

**State Data (Change-sets)**
- Incremental state transitions from each transaction
- Applied directly to RPC node cache without re-execution
- Enables instant state queries on pending transactions

**Non-state Data**
- Transaction payloads and receipts
- Internal transaction traces
- Block headers for pending blocks

#### Params
- `"latest"` - the latest finalized block from the sequencer
- `"pending"` - the current pending block that is pending finalization from the sequencer

#### Core Real-time API Examples

All Real-time APIs use standard eth_* methods with the "pending" block tag to access real-time data.

**eth_call - Smart Contract Interactions**

Execute contract calls against the latest real-time state.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_call", 
  "params": [
    {
      "to": "0x...",
      "data": "0x..."
    },
    "pending"
  ],
  "id": 1
}
```

Key Advantage: Full smart contract interaction support on pending blocks - a capability competitors like Base's flash blocks don't offer.

**eth_getBalance - Real-time Account Balances**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_getBalance",
  "params": ["0x...", "pending"],
  "id": 1
}
```

**eth_getTransactionCount - Latest Nonce**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0", 
  "method": "eth_getTransactionCount",
  "params": ["0x...", "pending"],
  "id": 1
}
```

**eth_getTransactionReceipt - Instant Receipts**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_getTransactionReceipt", 
  "params": ["0x..."],
  "id": 1
}
```

#### Real-time Subscriptions

Subscribe to live blockchain events via WebSocket connections.

**Subscribe to Real-time Updates**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_subscribe",
  "params": [
    "realtime",
    {
      "NewHeads": true,
      "TransactionExtraInfo": true, 
      "TransactionReceipt": true,
      "TransactionInnerTxs": true
    }
  ],
  "id": 1
}
```

**Subscription Response**

Real-time notifications include transaction hash, full transaction data, receipts, and internal transaction traces based on your subscription criteria.

## 2. Design

### 2.1 Overview
Realtime APIs are designed with pending and latest tags. The tag definitions are as follows:
- `latest` - the latest finalized block from the sequencer
- `pending` - the current pending block that is pending finalization from the sequencer

### 2.2 State APIs
State APIs also include account APIs. To use the realtime-enabled state APIs, users have to pass the "pending" tag. In the future, the realtime feature will look to support the "latest" tag (state APIs on the latest finalized block from the sequencer).

#### 2.2.1 Ensuring consistency
When users pass the "latest" tag to all state APIs, we are assured the integrity of chain-state is correct because these states are finalized on the sequencer. The realtime-enabled RPCs provide a faster and more updated chain-state, while default RPCs will reach eventual consistencies of the chain-state (slower since default RPCs are lagging behind RT-enabled RPCs).

When users pass the "pending" tag to all state APIs, users know the inherent risks of using the un-finalized chain-state. Realtime-enabled RPCs provides state APIs with the pending chain-state of the last sequenced transaction or the current pending block awaiting finalization from the sequencer - the state is deemed un-finalized since that block is currently still pending finalization.

### 2.3 Stateless APIs
Stateless APIs includes block APIs and transaction APIs.

#### 2.3.1 Block APIs
All block APIs follow the pending and latest tag design. For "latest" tag or specified block hashes / numbers, these blocks are assured to be finalized by the sequencer.

Realtime-enabled RPC nodes will also support "pending" tag, which will return the current pending block that is pending finalization. It will also include any transactions that have been minted by the sequencer into that pending block. Note that the block data return will not have a block hash, since the block is yet to be finalized.

#### 2.3.2 Transaction APIs
All transaction APIs on realtime-enabled RPC nodes will return transaction receipts once the sequencer includes the transaction in the current pending block. It is important to note that the realtime-enabled transaction APIs might be un-finalized, since lowest possible latency is prioritized.

However, users can check if transactions are finalized through the blockHash field. Transactions that are pending finalization will have an empty block hash, while finalized transactions will have the blockHash field populated with the finalized block hash.

#### 2.3.3 Ensuring stateless consistencies
Realtime APIs for stateless APIs (mainly block and transaction APIs) ensures consistency as:
1. Block data using the "latest" tag are guaranteed to be finalized
2. Transaction data are guaranteed to be finalized when blockHash field is populated

### 2.4 Integration Guide

#### Quick Start

**Step 1: Replace block tags in existing calls**
```javascript
// Before
await provider.getBalance(address, "latest")

// After (Real-time enabled)  
await provider.getBalance(address, "pending")
```

**Step 2: Add real-time subscriptions**
```javascript
const subscription = await provider.send("eth_subscribe", [
  "realtime",
  { NewHeads: true, TransactionReceipt: true }
]);
```

#### Migration Requirements
- **Minimal changes**: Replace "latest" with "pending" in block tags
- **Zero library changes**: Existing Ethereum client libraries work unchanged
- **Full API support**: All standard Ethereum JSON-RPC methods supported

### 2.5 Performance Benchmarks

#### Transaction Confirmation Speed
- **Real-time confirmations**: 26.6ms average
- **Traditional confirmations**: 400ms+ block times
- **Speed improvement**: 20-40x faster than traditional blockchain operations

#### Stress Test Results
- **Sustained TPS**: 860+ transactions per second
- **Real-time confirmations**: 26.6ms average
- **Zero sequencer restarts** on testnet to date

### 2.6 Use Cases

#### Ideal Applications
- **Wallet applications**: Instant transaction confirmations improve user trust
- **Payment systems**: Real-time verification for services like OKX Pay
- **Trading platforms**: Immediate state confirmations for better UX
- **DeFi protocols**: Fast balance and approval checks
- **Gaming applications**: Responsive on-chain interactions
- **Cross-chain bridges**: Quick state validation

### 2.7 Risk Considerations & Mitigation

#### Understanding Pending State
When using "pending" tags, transactions are pre-confirmed but not yet finalized on-chain.

**Potential Risks:**
- **Sequencer restart**: Pending transactions may not be included (extremely rare)
- **Chain reorganization**: Possible rollback scenarios (never occurred on testnet)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- **X Layer testnet**: Zero sequencer restarts to date
- **No rollbacks experienced** in testing
- **Standard blockchain finality rules** apply for critical operations
- **Built-in consistency checks** and atomic updates

### 2.8 Getting Started

#### Testnet Access
- **RPC Endpoint**: https://testnet-rpc.xlayer.tech
- **WebSocket**: wss://testnet-rpc.xlayer.tech

#### Example Implementation
```javascript
const { ethers } = require('ethers');

// Connect with Real-time support
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider('https://testnet-rpc.xlayer.tech');

async function getRealtimeBalance(address) {
  // Real-time balance with 20-30ms confirmation
  const balance = await provider.send("eth_getBalance", [address, "pending"]);
  return balance;
}

async function executeRealtimeCall(contract, data) {
  // Contract call against latest pending state
  const result = await provider.send("eth_call", [
    { to: contract, data: data },
    "pending"
  ]);
  return result;
}
```
