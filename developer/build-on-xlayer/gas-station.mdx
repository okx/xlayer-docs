# Gas station
X Layer gas station aims to help DApp developers by suggesting gas prices before they send transactions on the X Layer network. 
It's now on the X Layer testnet, checking 1500 recent transactions for price recommendations.

## Usage
Send a GET request to the [X Layer Gas Station endpoint](https://testrpc.xlayer.tech/gasstation "X Layer Gas Station endpoint") to get a gas price recommendation from this oracle.

### cURL
```shell
curl https://testrpc.xlayer.tech/gasstation
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
fetch('https://testrpc.xlayer.tech/gasstation')  .then(response => response.json())  .then(json => console.log(json))
```

### Python
```python
import requestsrequests.get('https://testrpc.xlayer.tech/gasstation').json()
```

## Interpretation
An example JSON response will look like this:
```json
{
        "safeLow": 1,
        "standard": 1,
        "fast": 1,
        "fastest": 1,
        "blockTime": 2,
        "blockNumber": 308789
}
```

- `safelow`, `standard`, `fast`, `fastest` are gas prices in Gwei. Feel free to utilize these prices according to your requirements before submitting the transaction to the X Layer testnet.
- `blockTime`, in seconds, gives the average block time of the network.
- `blockNumber` furnishes details about the most recent mined block at the time the recommendation was generated.
