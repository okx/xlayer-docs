# Snapshots

Using snapshots significantly reduces the initial sync time for X Layer RPC nodes. Snapshots are updated regularly and can be used with both **geth** and **reth** execution clients.

> **💡 Recommended**: For most users, we recommend using the [one-click setup script](./setup-rpc) which automatically handles snapshot download and extraction. This page is intended for advanced users who need to manually download snapshots (e.g., for data recovery or custom setups).

## 💡 Important Notes

* **Disk Space**: Ensure you have at least **500GB** free space for mainnet snapshots (both for the archive and extracted data)
* **Network Speed**: Snapshots are large files (several GB), so a stable internet connection is recommended
* **Latest Snapshots**: The latest snapshot filenames are fetched dynamically, so you'll always get the most recent version
* **Data Structure**: After extraction, move the chain data directories (e.g., `chaindata`, `nodes`, `segments`) directly into your data directory, not nested within another subfolder

## 📥 Download Snapshots

If you prefer to manually download and set up snapshots instead of using the one-click setup script, please choose the appropriate snapshot for your network and client from the table below.

| Network | Client | Snapshot Type | Download Command |
| ------- | ------ | ------------- | --------------------------- |
| Mainnet | Reth | Archive | `wget https://static.okx.com/cdn/chain/xlayer/snapshot/$(curl -s https://static.okx.com/cdn/chain/xlayer/snapshot/reth-mainnet-latest)` |
| Mainnet | Geth | Archive | `wget https://static.okx.com/cdn/chain/xlayer/snapshot/$(curl -s https://static.okx.com/cdn/chain/xlayer/snapshot/geth-mainnet-latest)` |
| Testnet | Reth | Archive | `wget https://static.okx.com/cdn/chain/xlayer/snapshot/$(curl -s https://static.okx.com/cdn/chain/xlayer/snapshot/reth-testnet-latest)` |
