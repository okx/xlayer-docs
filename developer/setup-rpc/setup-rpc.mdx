# Setup mainnet RPC

xlayer-erigon is a fork of Erigon, optimized for syncing with the X Layer network.



## Minimum System Requirements

- 128 GB RAM

- 8 core CPU

- 700 GB Storage ( IOPS > 40000 for AWS or IOPS > 100000 for Aliyun required )



## Start RPC Node



### Preparation

***Important: A Golang environment with version 1.24 or above is required.***



### Build

```bash
# Pull the code from GitHub，
git clone https://github.com/okx/xlayer-erigon.git

# If you are not aware of the latest version, you can use the following Github address to obtain the latest version：
https://github.com/okx/xlayer-erigon/releases

# Enter the xlayer-erigon directory
cd xlayer-erigon

# Then based on https://github.com/okx/xlayer-erigon/releases Switch to the corresponding branch based on the latest version found on
git checkout ${latest_release}

# Build the project. This process takes about 1 minute. After completion, the binary file will be located in the build/bin directory of the project, and the binary file name is: cdk-erigon.
make cdk-erigon

# If you want to generate an image, you can use the following methods：
make build-docker

```


### Modfiy Config

Create a configuration file named `xlayerconfig-mainnet.yaml` in the root directory of the project. Then, paste the following content into the file.
**Please note:** There are two fields that need to be updated:

1. `datadir` — specify your desired data directory path. Set this to the extracted snapshot directory.
2. `zkevm.l1_rpc_url` — provide the correct L1 RPC URL.For production environments, you should request an official RPC endpoint from your organization.

```yaml
# Place the extracted snapshot data into this directory
datadir: ${your-data-dir}
chain: xlayer-mainnet
http: true
private.api.addr: localhost:9091
zkevm.l2-chain-id: 196
zkevm.l2-sequencer-rpc-url: https://rpc.xlayer.tech
zkevm.l2-datastreamer-url: stream.xlayer.tech:8800

```

### How to use snapshot (optional)
Use a snapshot to speed up the initial sync.

1. Download: Get the latest mainnet snapshot from [here](https://static.okex.org/cdn/chain/xlayer/snapshot/index.html "snapshot"). The file name usually looks like `xlayer-erigon-mainnet-snap-YYYYMMDDHHMM.tar.gz`.
    - If your config enables `zkevm.standalone-smt-db: true`, download the "Standalone SMT DB" snapshot; otherwise download the default (non-standalone) snapshot. The snapshot type must match your `datadir` layout to avoid startup failures or forced database rebuilds.
2. Prepare directory: Make sure the path you set in `datadir` exists and has enough free space. If the directory is not empty, back up or clean it first to avoid mixing with old data.
3. Extract and set `datadir` (use the extracted directory as `datadir`):
```bash
tar -xzf xlayer-erigon-mainnet-snap-*.tar.gz
# Identify the extracted top-level directory and set `datadir` to that directory
```
4. Start the node using the command below. The client will continue syncing from the snapshot state.

Notes:
- `${your-data-dir}` must be the snapshot data directory itself (no extra parent level). Do not set it to the path of the compressed file.
- If you are using Docker, mount `${your-data-dir}` into the container as the data volume.


### Start Erigon Node By binary

To start the node, run the binary located at `./build/bin/cdk-erigon`.
Use the `--config` flag to specify the path to the configuration file you want to use.

```bash
./build/bin/cdk-erigon --config="./xlayerconfig-mainnet.yaml"


# If you see the following content in your log, the startup is successful：

```



## Preload the files into the OS page cache
Preloading the node's data into the OS page cache reduces cold disk I/O during state reads and block execution. By warming frequently accessed files and key ranges in memory, it can improve block synchronization efficiency and execution speed, enhance overall node and RPC performance.
### Compile vmtouch
```bash
git clone https://github.com/okx/vmtouch.git
cd vmtouch
make
sudo make install
```
### Map disk files into memory
```bash
vmtouch -vt ${your-data-dir}
```
