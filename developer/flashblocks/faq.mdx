# Flashblocks FAQ

## Flashblocks Block Building

### How many flashblocks per L2 block?

Typically 3-5 flashblocks can be built within the X Layer's 1-second block time, each representing ~200ms intervals. The exact number depends on network conditions and transaction volume.

### When will there be fewer than 5 flashblocks in each block?

When the network is congested and the previous flashblock takes too long to build, the protocol automatically compensates to fit fewer flashblocks within the 1-second block window.

### In what scenario will the sequencer stop producing flashblocks?

In the unlikely scenario where all reth sequencers fail, the backup sequencer (without flashblocks) takes over to build blocks, then flashblocks will stop producing.

### What are the implications of a reorg?

This means that a transaction was streamed out as a pre-confirmed transaction, but may not actually be included in the canonical chain.

### How often does a reorg occur?

Reorgs may happen during sequencer changes, but they still occur very rarely. It is good practice for applications to handle them appropriately when they do occur. As we collect more operational data, we will provide detailed metrics on reorg frequency and patterns.

## Flashblocks WebSocket

### What is WebSocket streaming?

Raw flashblock streaming provides lower-level access to flashblock data with potentially lower latency but requires custom parsing.
