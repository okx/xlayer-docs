# Deploying with Foundry
In this tutorial, we explain step-by-step how to create, compile and deploy a simple smart contract on the X Layer testnet using Foundry.

## What is Foundry
[Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry "Foundry") offers a complete set of tools for building and deploying decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. Utilizing Foundry, you can write smart contracts using the Solidity programming language, compile, deploy, and interact on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Setting up the development environment
- [Node.js V18+ LTS and npm](https://nodejs.org/en "Node.js V18+ LTS and npm") (comes with node)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/ "Git")

If you have not installed Foundry, go to book.getfoundry and select Installation from the side menu. Follow the instructions to download using Foundryup.
```shell
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```
If everything goes successfully, you can use four CLI in the terminal: forge, cast, anvil, and chisel.

## Creating your contract
Initialize a project with the following command:
```shell
forge init hello_contract
cd hello_contract
```
In the `hello_contract/src` folder,  you can edit the `Counter.sol` file:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract Counter {
    uint256 public number;

    function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) public {
        number = newNumber;
    }

    function increment() public {
        number++;
    }
}
```

## Compiling your contract
Next, you can compile the contract with the `forge` command:
```shell
forge build
```
If all goes accordingly, you will see the details:
```shell
[⠔] Compiling...
[⠢] Compiling 22 files with 0.8.16
[⠔] Solc 0.8.16 finished in 2.75s
Compiler run successful!
```

## Deploying your contract
You can run the **forge create** command to deploy your contract. Replace the **HTTP_URL** with your actual endpoint, and **PRIVATE_KEY** with your actual private key.
```bash
forge create --rpc-url HTTP_URL \
--private-key PRIVATE_KEY \
src/Counter.sol: Counter
```
If it goes well, you will see the details such as:
```shell

```

## Interacting with your contract
You can run the **cast** command to interact with your contract.
Write a call with the **setNumber** function, such as:
```bash
cast send CONTRACT_ADDRESS "setNumber(uint256)" 10 --rpc-url HTTP_URL --private-key PRIVATE_KEY
```
If all goes accordingly, you will see the details:

Read a call with the **number** function, such as:
```bash

```
If all goes accordingly, you will see the details:
