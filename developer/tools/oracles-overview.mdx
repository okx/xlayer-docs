# Oracles
Oracles are crucial components in the blockchain ecosystem, enabling smart contracts to interact with real-world data and external systems. These services, such as Chainlink, API3, Supra, Redstone provide secure and reliable data feeds, allowing decentralized applications (dApps) to access off-chain information like market prices, weather data, and event outcomes.
