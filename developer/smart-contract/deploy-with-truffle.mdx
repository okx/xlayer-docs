# Deploying with Truffle
In this tutorial, we explain step-by-step how to create, compile and deploy a simple smart contract on the Xgon testnet using Truffle.
## What is Truffle?
Truffle is the most popular development tooling for Ethereum programmers.
## Setting up the development environment
There are a few technical requirements before we start. Please install the following: 
- [Node.js v18 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/ "Node.js v18 LTS") or later
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/ "Git")

**Recommendations for Windows users**:
If you're running Truffle on Windows, you may encounter some naming conflicts that could prevent Truffle from executing properly. Please see the section on resolving naming conflicts for solutions.
Once we have those installed, we only need one command to install Truffle:
```
npm install -g truffle
```
To verify that Truffle is installed properly, type `truffle version` on a terminal. If you see an error, make sure that your npm modules are added to your path.

## Creating a project
The first step is to create a Truffle project. We'll use **MegaCoin** as an example, which allows you to create a token that can be transferred between accounts:
- Create a new directory for your Truffle project:
```
mkdir MegaCoin
cd MegaCoin
```
- Intialize your project:
```
truffle init
```
Once this operation is completed, you'll now have a project structure with the following items:
- `contracts/`: Directory for Solidity contracts
- `migrations/`: Directory for scriptable deployment files
- `test/`: Directory for test files for testing your application and contracts
- `truffle-config.js`: Truffle configuration file
## Creating a contract
You can write your own smart contract or download the [ERC20 token smart contract template](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc20 "ERC20 token smart contract template").
## Compiling a contract
To compile a Truffle project, change to the root of the directory where the project is located and then type the following into a terminal:
```
truffle compile
```
**Config Truffle for Xgon**:
- Go to truffle-config.js
- Update the truffle-config with Xgon-network-crendentials

```
const HDWalletProvider = require('truffle-hdwallet-provider');
const fs = require('fs');
const mnemonic = fs.readFileSync(".secret").toString().trim();

module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",     // Localhost (default: none)
      port: 8545,            // Standard Xgon port (default: none)
      network_id: "*",       // Any network (default: none)
    },
    testnet: {
      provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, `https://okb-xxx.okx.com`),
      network_id:195 ,
      confirmations: 10,
      timeoutBlocks: 200,
      skipDryRun: true
    },
  },

  // Set default mocha options here, use special reporters etc.
  mocha: {
    // timeout: 100000
  },

  // Configure your compilers
  compilers: {
    solc: {
    }
  }
}
```
<Tip title="Note" >It requires mnemonic to be passed in for Provider. This is the seed phrase for the account you'd like to deploy from. 
Create a new `.secret` file in the root directory and enter your 12 word mnemonic seed phrase to get started. To get the seedphrase from metamask wallet, you can go to Metamask Settings, then from the menu choose Security and Privacy where you will see a button that says reveal seedphrase.</Tip>

## Deploying your contract
Run this command in the root of the project directory:
```
$ truffle migrate --network testnet
```
The contract will be deployed on Xgon Chapel Testnet. It looks like this:
```
1_initial_migration.js
