# About X Layer

X Layer is a cutting-edge Ethereum layer 2 (L2) network built by OKX and Polygon using Polygon's CDK. It offers full compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), enabling developers to deploy existing Ethereum applications and develop new, innovative projects at a fraction of the cost compared to doing so on Ethereum. X Layer also enables users to use dapps at significantly lower gas fees and faster speed compared to Ethereum. 

X Layer's underlying architecture is that of a zkEVM validium, which means that transactions are secured via ZK proofs. This architecture is a close sibling of ZK rollup, but it offers the following advantages over rollups:
- Significantly lower fees, since they don't consume expensive Ethereum gas
- Significantly higher scalability, since rollupsâ€™ throughput is bounded by the amount of transaction data that can be published to Ethereum.
X Layer uses the OKB token as it's native gas fees. Getting started with X Layer is straightforward, you can by funding your Web3 wallet (we support many!), or by bridging over funds.
