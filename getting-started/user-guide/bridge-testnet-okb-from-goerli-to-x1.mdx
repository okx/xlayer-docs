# Bridge testnet OKB from Sepolia to X1
**[X1 testnet faucet](http://www.okx.com/x1/faucet "X1 testnet faucet")** is the official tool provided by the X1 team for developers to claim test tokens. Developers can use X1 testnet faucet to obtain **testnet OKB  tokens** and other ERC-20 tokens.

Users can mint a certain amount of testnet OKB on the Sepolia testnet and then use our official X1 bridge to bridge OKB (or other test tokens) from Sepolia to the X1 testnet. 

<Tip title="Note">Please ensure that your wallet contains enough ETH (Sepolia ETH) for gas fees on the Sepolia network. You can also use the X1 bridge to bridge ETH to the X1 testnet.</Tip>

## How to claim ETH
You can obtain ETH from the following third-party faucets, each with its own claiming requirements. Choose the one that suits your needs:
- [Quick Node](https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/sepolia)
- [Alchemy](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)

If you have already claimed ETH, you can switch your wallet network to the Sepolia network and check if the ETH has been credited. 

If you are using the OKX Wallet, you need to enable **Settings - Custom network** and select the Sepolia network.

## X1 Sepolia faucet
1. Navigate to the X1 testnet faucet official website and click the **Mint OKB on Sepolia** button to proceed.
