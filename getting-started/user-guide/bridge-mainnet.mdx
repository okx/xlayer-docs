## FAQ

### How to clear your account activity/reset account in MetaMask？
How to clear your account activity/reset account in MetaMask？
You should only clear your account activity when strictly necessary, most often to resolve stuck and pending transactions. 

This function is intended primarily for developers, who may find it useful to clear an account's activity on a test network while continuing to use the same account. 

Note that clearing account activity only affects the current network. For example: if you're on X Layer testnet, the only activity that will be cleared are your transactions on X Layer testnet. Transactions on other networks, such as Ethereum, will be unaffected.

<Tip title="Note" >
**Clearing your activity is irreversible, and not a common requirement for most users. You will not lose value in your accounts.** 
</Tip>

To reset the account:

1. Click the three vertical dots in the top-right corner, and then go to **Settings > Advanced**.
